I thought of including my unreleased techno track in the release files but while using it in dev I realized its tremendous promise which I don't want other people to take the credit for thus that's out for now.


== Building ==

So you should just download the release executable and run that. If you want alarm make a folder called 'media' where the executable is and place a wav file called 'evac.wav' in 'media' dir, else you would get some system specific sound which really suckks.

And how to build from src files will come here soon....
